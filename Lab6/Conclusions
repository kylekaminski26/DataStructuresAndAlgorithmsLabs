During the creation of Lab 6, I learned how to properly use a DEQ.
DEQs are useful for when I want a First In, First Out list.
DEQs can also be used for adding elements to the beginning or end, based on how you want it, which makes them extremely flexible to use.
DEQs are my personal favorite so far and I hope to use them in future programs I write.
