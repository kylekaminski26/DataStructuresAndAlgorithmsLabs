During this lab, I learned how to properly use stacks.
At first, I did not understand what the phrase First In, Last Out meant, but now I can properly use it to my advantage in my code.
I will use stacks in future programs I write because it makes more sense to me now, and in some way they provide more of an advantage than array lists.
