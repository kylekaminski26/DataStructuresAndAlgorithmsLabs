During the creation of Lab 3, I learned that the application program that I wrote for labs 1 and 2 is extremely flexible and can be added to and changed very easily.
This lab has taught me what the compareTo method is in the String class.
This lab has also taught me to use the compareTo method to compare two different strings and see which string holds more value over the other.
Overall, I will use the compareTo method, as well as the String class, a lot more now since I know what they are capable of.
