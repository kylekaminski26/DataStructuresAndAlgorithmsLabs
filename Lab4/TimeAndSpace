For a list of n items:

Space Complexity:
CDLS uses 24 bytes of memory.
This is because each node has 8 bytes.
Of those 8 bytes, 4 bytes are for data and 4 are for holding the address.

Time Complexity:

get()
	Best = 0
	Worst = 0
	Average = 0 
	
add()
	Best = 0
	Worst = n
	Average = n/2 
	
remove()
	Best = 0
	Worst = n-1
	Average = (n-1)/2
