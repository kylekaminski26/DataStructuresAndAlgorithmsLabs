During the creation of this lab, I learned how to make a Recursive Quick Sort, as well as an Iterative Merge Sort.
The Recursive Quick Sort calls itself over and over to sort the array.
The Iterative Merge Sort uses iteration to sort its array.
These methods gets the job done and are useful methods for sorting arrays.
